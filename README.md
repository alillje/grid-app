## CSS Grids made easy
Ever struggled with building layouts for your website?
<br>
**Visual Grid Generator** is the easiest and fastest way for web developers to create a CSS Layout.

With **Visual Grid Generator**, you can build your layouts visually, and generate the CSS code you need. 

* Build the layout by setting the number of rows and columns

* Select the areas where you want to insert your child elements by pressing down your left mouse button and dragging it. 

* Get the CSS code for the entire layout and all child elements.

Starting in web development, I found that setting grids with CSS could be confusing and complicated. 
<br>
The purpose of this application is to provide a way to start building grid layouts in an easy manner.
